	 <h2>The complete roadmap for full-stack development in 2023</h2><br/>
	 <p>Get to know the basic programming languages you will need to know about if you're looking for a career in full-stack development</p><br/>
	 <p>Becoming a full stack web developer seems to be a daunting task, especially if you are completely new to the field of coding. As a beginner, you might think that you have a whole lot to learn within a short span of time.</p><br/>
	 <p>The languages, frameworks, libraries and databases along with everything else required are considered to be a list of tools for full stack web development. The easiest way to begin any work is to strategize with a roadmap. A roadmap is the best way to kick-start your attempt to become a full stack web developer.</p><br/>
	 <p>Your objective should be to learn the bare minimum skill-set required so that you can start experimenting and honing your learned skills. Once you have mastered the basics, you can go ahead and learn full stack technologies which will give you an edge over others. Follow a structured path and equip yourself steadily rather than trying to learn the entire web development spectrum.</p><br/>
	 <p>In this blog, you will find a complete full-stack roadmap of 2023. It is the go-to guide for organizing and selecting technologies to learn. The roadmap is similar to the full-stack roadmap of 2020 that we wrote about earlier. </p><br/>
	 <p>This article will mainly benefit the noobs but is also useful for professional coders looking to become full-stack web developers. If you already have knowledge of some of the technologies we are going to talk about here, skip to the sections that will be useful to you. Feel free to customize this roadmap to suit your needs.  </p>

	<h3>Back-end technology roadmap for full-stack web development</h3><br/>
	<p>You need to be proficient in multiple programming languages as most of the core processes for any business have to be written in them. It is not possible to master all of them in a short time, so we have a list of languages for you to begin with. </p><br/>
	
	<p><strong className="font-size-control">PHP</strong>- PHP is the most popular scripting language, and it can be embedded into HTML. PHP scripts can only be interpreted on a server where PHP is installed. It is used to collect form data and send or receive cookies amongst other functions.</p><br/>
	<p><strong className="font-size-control">Python</strong>- Python is a high-level, general-purpose language. It can be used on a server to create web applications, mathematics and server scripting. It connects to databases to read and manipulate files. Python was designed for readability and runs on an interpreter system. It can also be used in a procedural, object-oriented or functional way. </p><br/>
	<p><strong className="font-size-control">Ruby</strong>- A dynamic, open source language, Ruby is easy to learn and code. It focuses on productivity and simplicity, and it can be used for web applications, servers, system utilities, backups and database works.</p><br/>
	<p><strong className="font-size-control">NodeJS</strong>- NodeJS is an open-source, cross-platform in nature that runs across various platforms. it is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript outside a browser.</p><br/>
	<p>Developers need a back-end framework so that an application can be created. It is the script-side of a dynamic application. A lot of options are available for back-end frameworks. </p><br/>
	<p><strong className="font-size-control">Express</strong>- Express.js is a framework used as a web application for Node.js. It is a module of NodeJS. It can be used for apps that are based on servers that will listen for connection requests from clients. It can be used for single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications. It is fast, easy to use and assertive.</p><br/>
	<p><strong className="font-size-control">Django</strong>- Django is a high-level Python web framework that follows model-template-view architecture. It is used to simplify the creation of complex, database-driven websites. It is fast and promotes a clean design. </p><br/>
	<p><strong className="font-size-control">Ruby on Rails</strong> - Ruby on Rails is a server-side web application framework based on the Ruby language. It provides default structures for databases, web services and web pages. It uses model-view-controller architecture. This is comparatively hard to learn as you have to learn multiple and independent concepts.</p><br/>

		<h3>Additional skills recommended for full-stack web development</h3><br/>
		<p><strong>Git</strong>- The most popular distributed version control system, Git is fast and efficient. It has the capacity to handle small to very large projects. It is used to coordinate between programmers as well as track any changes made to any code stored in its repository. Check out the git basics before getting started. GitHub is the most widely used code repository, and therefore a must learn for an aspiring coder. A GitHub roadmap is a crucial part in the full-stack learning course.</p><br/>
		<p><strong>HTTP/HTTPS </strong>-HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol used by the world wide web. it defines how messages are transmitted, and how actions are taken by web servers and browsers when responding to commands. HTTPS is the secured version of HTTP. Here, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security. It ensures protection against man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping.</p><br/>
		<p><strong>Linux command</strong>-line basic-Although it is not mandatory that you possess this skill, it is good to know about Linux. It is not necessarily easy or hard to learn. Linux makes the job easier and saves a lot of time by organizing items on the back-end</p><br/>
		<p><strong>Data structures and algorithms</strong>-Data structures are different ways of storing data, while an algorithm is a generic approach methodology to solve a problem or requirement. Every programmer needs to be familiar with these concepts. These are not core skills, but the more intuitive you are about these, the easier it is to solve issues or add requirements. The impacts are felt in efficiency, scalability and performance of an application. As a full stack developer, these courses will help you immensely.</p><br/>
