	<h1 class="h1">What is front end development?</h1>
	<p class="p">Front end development (sometimes written "frontend development") is like designing the face 
	of a website or app. It's all about how things look and feel when you use them. While back end 
	developers make sure everything works behind the scenes, front end developers focus on what you 
	see and interact with, making sure it's easy to use and looks good on any device. 
	In short, front end developers turn designs into live websites and apps that people can use.</p><br/>
	<p class="p">At its core, frontend development revolves around three main technologies: HTML, CSS, 
	and JavaScript. We will explain more about these technologies in a bit, but for now just know
	 that almost everything in frontend development revolves around them. As a frontend developer,
	  your role is pivotal in ensuring that the website's design translates well 
	to various devices, is user-friendly, and aligns with the client's vision.</p>

<div class="frontend-container">
<h1 class="h1">Essential Technologies for Frontend Development</h1>
<p class="p">So here are the essential technologies you need to learn. You can watch a full comprehensive course on each of these technologies, right on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel as part of this front end learning path.</p>
</div>

<div class="frontend-container">
	<h2 class="h2">Internet Basics</h2>
	<p class="p">The internet is a vast interconnected network that has revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and live. Before diving further into frontend development, it's essential to grasp the foundational concepts of how the internet functions.</p><br/>
	<p class="p">This foundational knowledge encompasses understanding domains, the Domain Name System (DNS), servers, and protocols like HTTP/HTTPS. Additionally, a basic comprehension of web browsers, their role, and how they render web pages is crucial for anyone looking to venture into web development.</p>
</div>
<div class="frontend-container">
      <h2 class="h2">
            HTML
      </h2>
      <p class="p">HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the cornerstone of web content. It's akin to the skeleton of a website, providing the essential structure upon which everything else is built.</p><br/>
      <p class="p">As the standard markup language for web pages, HTML uses tags to define elements and structure the content. From headings to paragraphs, links, and images, everything visible on a webpage is typically structured using HTML.</p>
</div>
<div class="frontend-container">
      <h2 class="h2">CSS</h2>
      <p class="p">If HTML is the skeleton of a website, CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is its skin. It's responsible for the visual appeal of a website, dictating everything from colors and fonts to layouts.</p><br/>
      <p class="p">CSS allows developers to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. It ensures that websites are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.</p>
</div>
<div class="frontend-container">
      <h2 class="h2">JavaScript</h2>
      <p class="p">JavaScript breathes life into static web pages. It's a dynamic programming language that introduces interactivity, making websites more engaging and user-centric.</p><br/>
      <p class="p">From simple animations to complex functionalities like form validations and asynchronous data fetching, JavaScript plays a pivotal role. It's the magic behind the dynamic behavior of web applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="frontend-container">
      <h2 class="h2">Version Control: Git and GitHub</h2>
      <p class="p">In the world of software development, tracking and managing changes is crucial. This is where version control systems, particularly Git, come into play.</p><br/>
      <p class="p">Git allows developers to track changes, collaborate seamlessly, and revert to previous versions if needed. GitHub, on the other hand, is a platform that hosts Git repositories, facilitating collaboration, code sharing, and even deployment.</p>
</div>
<div class="frontend-container">
      <h2 class="h2">Package Managers</h2>
      <p class="p">As projects grow and evolve, managing software libraries and dependencies can become a challenge. Package managers are tools designed to address this challenge.</p><br/>
      <p class="p">Popular package managers like npm or yarn help developers manage, install, and update software libraries seamlessly. They ensure that projects have the right versions of dependencies, making the development process smoother.</p>
</div>
<div class="frontend-container">
      <h2 class="h2">Bootstrap 5 and SASS</h2>
      <p class="p">Designing responsive and visually appealing websites can be streamlined with the right tools. Bootstrap is one such framework that has revolutionized web design.</p><br/>
      <p class="p">Bootstrap offers pre-designed components and a grid system, making responsive design a breeze. SASS, a CSS preprocessor, allows for advanced styling techniques, variables, and nested rules, enhancing the styling process.</p>
</div>
<div class="frontend-container">
      <h2 class="h2">JavaScript Frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc)</h2>
      <p class="p">Modern web applications demand efficiency, scalability, and maintainability. JavaScript frameworks and libraries provide pre-written code to support these requirements.</p><br/>

</div>
<div class="frontend-container">
      <h2 class="h2">Tailwind CSS</h2>
      <p class="p">Tailwind CSS has emerged as a game-changer in the world of CSS frameworks. It adopts a utility-first approach, allowing for rapid UI development.</p><br/>
      <p class="p">Instead of predefined components, Tailwind provides utility classes that can be combined to create custom designs. This approach promotes flexibility and reduces the need for custom CSS, leading to faster development cycles.</p>
</div>
<div class="frontend-container">
      <h2 class="h2">TypeScript</h2>
